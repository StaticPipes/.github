# StaticPipes, the flexible and extendable static site website generator in Python

Most static website generators have technologies, conventions and source code layout requirements that you have to follow. 

Instead this is a framework and a collection of pipelines to process your source files. 
Use only the pipelines you want and configure them as you need.
