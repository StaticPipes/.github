# StaticPipes - the unopinionated, flexible, and extendable static site website generator in Python

Most static website generators have technologies, conventions and source code layout requirements that you have to follow. 

Instead this is a framework and a collection of pipelines to process your source files. 
Use only the pipelines you want and configure them as you need. 

If you are a python programmer and need something different, then write a python class that extends our base class and write what you need.
